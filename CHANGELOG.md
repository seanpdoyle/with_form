## master

## [0.2.0] - April 12, 2020

While `with_form` can simplify `<form>` element interactions with multiple
steps, there are times when a single line of instructions is more convenient.

Behind the scenes, `with_form` utilize the `#label` and `#submit` helper
methods to translate `<label>` and `<button>` text, along with `<input
type="submit">` values.

To put the same helpers to use within your test, include the
`WithForm::TranslationHelpers` module and invoke either:

* `label(model_name, attribute)`

* `submit(model_name, action = :submit)`


## [0.1.0] - March 10, 2020

Leverage Rails-generated `<label>` values to submit `<form>` elements in System
Tests.

To add coverage to a form's fields that are generated by ActionView's
`form_with` helper, fill them using `with_form`
