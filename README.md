# WithForm

Your System Test's counterpart to `form_with`

## Usage

Leverage Rails-generated `<label>` values to submit `<form>` elements in System
Tests.

### The `with_form` test helper

To add coverage to a form's fields that are generated by ActionView's
`form_with` helper, fill them using `with_form`:

```ruby
class UserInteractsWithFormsTest < ApplicationSystemTestCase
  include WithForm::TestHelpers

  test "user signs in" do
    visit new_session_path
    with_form(scope: :session) do |form|
      form.fill_in :email, with: "user@example.com"
      form.fill_in :password, with: "secr3t"
      form.check :remember_me
      form.click_button
    end

    assert_text "Welcome back, user@example.com."
  end

  test "user makes a post" do
    post = Post.new(title: "My First Post", tags: ["ruby", "testing"])

    visit new_post_path
    with_form(model: post) do |form|
      form.fill_in :title
      form.check :tags
      form.click_button
    end

    assert_text "Created Post: My First Post."
  end

  test "user updates their profile" do
    profile = Profile.create!

    visit profile_path
    with_form(model: profile) do |form|
      form.fill_in :email, with: "updated.user@example.com"
      form.select "NY", from: :state
      form.click_button :update
    end

    assert_text "Your profile has been updated."
  end
end
```

### `with_form` Options

The `with_form` helper method accepts two styles of options:

* `scope:` - the internationalization scope key to use when translating Capybara's
  locator values

  When submitting a `<form>` through a call to `form.click_button`, you can pass
  an `action` as the translation scope. A `with_form(scope:)` call will default
  to the `submit` key when one is not specified. For instance:

  ```ruby
  form_with(scope: :post) do |form|
    form.click_button
  end
  ```

  This call will search for an `<input type="text">` or `<button>` whose `value`
  or text content is the String translated by the `helpers.submit.post.submit`
  key.

  That action can be overridden:

  ```ruby
  form_with(scope: :post) do |form|
    form.click_button :create
  end
  ```

* `model:` - an instance of an `ActiveModel::Model` or `ActiveRecord::Base` to
  be used to translate Capybara's locator values, and to populate the fields
  with an attribute's value.

  For example, assuming that a `Post` record has a `title` attribute:

  ```ruby
  post = Post.new(title: "The Title")

  form_with(model: post) do |form|
    form.fill_in :title
  end
  ```

  The call to `form.fill_in` will search for an [`<input>` element][input] or a
  [`<textarea>` element][textarea] that is labelled by a
  [`<label>` element][label] whose value is translated from the
  `helpers.label.post.title` internationalization key. If that element exists,
  set its value to the value of `post.title` (in this case, `"The Title"`).

  An attribute's value can be overridden by providing
  a different value. For instance, assuming that a `Post` record has a `title`
  attribute:

  ```ruby
  post = Post.create!(title: "Old Title")

  form_with(model: post) do |form|
    form.fill_in :title, with: "New Title"
  end
  ```

  The call to `form.fill_in` will work much like the example above, with the
  exception that the provided `with:` option's value (in this case,
  `"New Title"`) will take precedence over the `post.title` attribute's value
  (in this case, `"Old Title"`).

  When submitting a `<form>` through a call to `form.click_button`, you can pass
  an `action` as the translation scope. A `with_form(model:)` call will
  determine the translation key based on [the `model`
  argument's persistence state][persisted].

  When a `model` instance is a new record, the key will use `create`. For
  instance:

  ```ruby
  post = Post.new

  form_with(model: post) do |form|
    form.click_button
  end
  ```

  This call will search for an `<input type="text">` or `<button>` whose `value`
  or text content is the String translated by the `helpers.submit.post.create`
  key.

  That action can be overridden:

  ```ruby
  post = Post.new

  form_with(model: post) do |form|
    form.click_button :submit
  end
  ```

  When a `model` instance is an existing persisted record, the key will use
  `update`. For instance:

  ```ruby
  post = Post.last

  form_with(model: post) do |form|
    form.click_button
  end
  ```

  This call will search for an `<input type="text">` or `<button>` whose `value`
  or text content is the String translated by the `helpers.submit.post.update`
  key.

  That action can be overridden:

  ```ruby
  post = Post.last

  form_with(model: post) do |form|
    form.click_button :submit
  end
  ```

With the exception of `#click_link` and `#click_link_or_button`, the argument
yielded to `with_form` supports [all helper methods made available by
`Capybara::Node::Actions`][actions].

Those include:

* `attach_file(locator = nil, paths, make_visible: nil, **options)`
* `check(locator, **options)`
* `choose(locator, **options)`
* `click_button(locator, nil, **options)`
* `fill_in(locator, with: nil, **options)`
* `select(value = nil, from: nil, **options)`
* `uncheck(locator, **options)`
* `unselect(value = nil, from: nil, **options)`

### The `label` and `submit` test helpers

While `with_form` can simplify `<form>` element interactions with multiple
steps, there are times when a single line of instructions is more convenient.

Behind the scenes, `with_form` utilize the `#label` and `#submit` helper
methods to translate `<label>` and `<button>` text, along with `<input
type="submit">` values.

To put the same helpers to use within your test, include the
`WithForm::TranslationHelpers` module and invoke either:

* `label(model_name, attribute)`

* `submit(model_name, action = :submit)`

For example when clicking an `<input type="checkbox">` labelled by a translation
declared at `helpers.label.session.ready`:

```ruby
class UserInteractsWithFormsTest < ApplicationSystemTestCase
  include WithForm::TranslationHelpers

  test "user ticks a box" do
    visit new_session_path
    check label(:session, :ready)

    assert_text "We're glad you're ready, user@example.com."
  end
end
```

Or, to destroy a Post by clicking a button labelled by a translation declared at
`helpers.submit.post.destroy`:

```ruby
class UserInteractsWithFormsTest < ApplicationSystemTestCase
  include WithForm::TranslationHelpers

  test "user deletes a post" do
    visit new_post_path
    click_on submit(:post, :destroy)

    assert_text "Deleted Post."
  end
end
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'with_form'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Then, include the `WithForm::TestHelpers` into your project testing framework.

### MiniTest

```ruby
# test/application_system_test_case.rb
class ApplicationSystemTestCase < ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase
  include WithForm::TestHelpers
end
```

### RSpec

```ruby
# spec/support/with_form.rb
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include(WithForm::TestHelpers, type: :system)
end
```

## FAQ

I want to call a Capybara helper with that input's [`id` attribute][mdn-id]
or [`name` attribute][mdn-name]. How can I do that?

* You can mix the object that you invoke the helper methods on within the
  `with_form` block. For instance:

  ```ruby
  with_form(scope: :post) do |form|
    form.fill_in :title, with: "The Post's Title"
    fill_in "another-field-id", with: "Another Value"
    fill_in "post[special-field]", with: "Special Value"
  end
  ```

I've used the [`formulaic` gem][formulaic] before. How is this gem different?

* Formulaic's `fill_form` and `fill_form_and_submit` are very useful
  abstractions over [`simple_form`-generated `<form>` elements][simple_form].
  This gem's focus is at a different layer of abstraction. Instead of translating
  a Hash of attribute-value pairs into `<form>` element interactions, this gem's
  interface focussed on enhancing the experience of filling in
  [`form_with`-generated `<form>` elements][form_with] that are labelled by the
  [`ActionView`-provided internationalization tooling][rails-i18n].
